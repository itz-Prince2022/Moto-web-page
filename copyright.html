Copyrights protect “original works of authorship,” such as writings, art, architecture, and music. For as long as the copyright is in effect, the copyright owner has the sole right to display, share, perform, or license the material.

One notable exception is the “fair use” doctrine, which allows some degree of distribution of copyrighted material for scholarly, educational, or news-reporting purposes.

Technically, you don’t have to file for a copyright to have the piece of work protected. It’s considered yours once your ideas are translated into a tangible form, such as a book, music, or published research; however, officially registering with the U.S. Copyright Office before—or within five years of—publishing your work makes it a lot easier to establish that you were the original author if you ever have to go to court. 

The duration of a copyright depends on the year it was created, as the laws have changed over the years. Since 1978, most compositions have been copyright-protected for 70 years after the author’s death. After that time, individual works enter the public domain and can be reproduced by anyone without permission.
 

As a general rule, the author retains ownership of copyright privileges, even if the material is published by another company. There is an important exception to this rule, though.

Materials you create for your employer as part of your job requirements, for example, contributions to a podcast the company publishes, are usually considered "works for hire." The employer, not you, retains the copyright. If there’s a gray area, you can try to negotiate with the publisher over copyright ownership prior to creating the piece; just be sure to get it in writing.
